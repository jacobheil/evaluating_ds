## Opportunities for Peer-Review of Projects
### [DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/journal/about)
Peer review of in-process projects. From the site: 
>DHCommons aims to bridge the “evaluation gap” between the Digital Humanities and more traditional disciplinary scholarship. Digital projects often continue for many years as a continuum of work. Rather than building to a single publication moment as monographs do, digital projects often mark mark progress through a series of significant milestones. DHCommons will provide a concrete way to certify the value of long-standing, influential, but unfinished projects to colleagues unfamiliar with the contours of digital scholarship.

### [The Advanced Research Consortium](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/about/peer-review/)
