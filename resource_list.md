## Organizational Guidelines
These are some official guidelines that may be useful in thinking through what's important in your work and/or demonstrating how other organizations have tried to generalize responsible and reasonable evaluation of digital scholarship.

## Ethics and Evaluation
* [On Capacity and Care](http://nowviskie.org/2015/on-capacity-and-care/)
Because everyone should read it, Bethany Nowviskie's post [On Capacity and Care](http://nowviskie.org/2015/on-capacity-and-care/) offers a much needed call to remember the human side of our endeavors. 
>What would the technical platforms and digital humanities communities of practice we are building look like if they were more self-consciously predicated on a something the humanities values deeply and performs well?—that is, on care, in its many manifestations across our fields. How might taking care—and taking the concept of care more seriously in graduate education and cultural heritage infrastructure-building—serve to expand our scope?

## Readings
### [Challenges of DS](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-challenges-of-digital-scholarship/38103), Adeline Koh, ProfHacker, 25 JAN 2015
Her first bullet -- but really the whole post -- is about educating your audience. This, then, is a great guide for figuring out how you can talk about your work specifically and for painting the larger, contextual landscape for your peers and evaluators. 

### [Closing the Evaluation Gap](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/closing-the-evaluation-gap/), Fall 2012, Journal of Digital Humanities
Includes an overview section, [The Problem Stated](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/living-in-a-digital-world-by-sheila-cavanagh/), as well as an incredible discipline- and/or medium-specific section on [Approaches](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/how-to-evaluate-digital-scholarship-by-todd-presner/). Includes especially useful and bullet pointed [Short Guide to Evaluation of DS](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/short-guide-to-evaluation-of-digital-work-by-geoffrey-rockwell/). Also of note, Zach Coble's [Guidelines for Librarians](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-digital-humanities-work-guidelines-for-librarians-by-zach-coble/). These are all at least four years old now, but they remain (IMO) solid foundations when thinking through your own and/or your institutions position vis-a-vis digital scholarship.

### [Evaluating Digital Scholarship](http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1632/prof.2011.2011.1.123), Fall 2011, [Profession](http://www.mlajournals.org/toc/prof/2011/1)
Older still and discipline specific, but the ways in which these authors frame their discussions might provide useful scaffolding for other disciplines or contexts. 

## Opportunities for Peer-Review of Projects
### [DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/journal/about)
Peer review of in-process projects. From the site: 
>DHCommons aims to bridge the “evaluation gap” between the Digital Humanities and more traditional disciplinary scholarship. Digital projects often continue for many years as a continuum of work. Rather than building to a single publication moment as monographs do, digital projects often mark mark progress through a series of significant milestones. DHCommons will provide a concrete way to certify the value of long-standing, influential, but unfinished projects to colleagues unfamiliar with the contours of digital scholarship.

### [The Advanced Research Consortium](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/about/peer-review/)
A collection of nodes organized around specifically literary periods or movements. Includes nodes for C19 literature ([NINES](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/nines/)), C18 literature ([18thConnect](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/18thconnect/)), and medieval literature ([MESA](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/mesa/)) and is growing.
