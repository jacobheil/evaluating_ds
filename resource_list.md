## Readings
### [Challenges of DS](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-challenges-of-digital-scholarship/38103), Adeline Koh, ProfHacker, 25 JAN 2015
Her first bullet -- but really the whole post -- is about educating your audience. This, then, is a great guide for figuring out how you can talk about your work specifically and for painting the larger, contextual landscape for your peers and evaluators. 

### [Closing the Evaluation Gap](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/closing-the-evaluation-gap/), Fall 2012, Journal of Digital Humanities
Includes an overview section, [The Problem Stated](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/living-in-a-digital-world-by-sheila-cavanagh/), as well as an incredible discipline- and/or medium-specific section on [Approaches](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/how-to-evaluate-digital-scholarship-by-todd-presner/). Includes especially useful and bullet pointed [Short Guide to Evaluation of DS](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/short-guide-to-evaluation-of-digital-work-by-geoffrey-rockwell/). Also of note, Zach Coble's [Guidelines for Librarians](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-digital-humanities-work-guidelines-for-librarians-by-zach-coble/). These are all at least four years old now, but they remain (IMO) solid foundations when thinking through your own and/or your institutions position vis-a-vis digital scholarship.

### [Evaluating Digital Scholarship](http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1632/prof.2011.2011.1.123), Fall 2011, [Profession](http://www.mlajournals.org/toc/prof/2011/1)
Older still and discipline specific, but the ways in which these authors frame their discussions might provide useful scaffolding for other disciplines or contexts. 

## Opportunities for Peer-Review of Projects
### [DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/journal/about)
Peer review of in-process projects. From the site: 
>DHCommons aims to bridge the “evaluation gap” between the Digital Humanities and more traditional disciplinary scholarship. Digital projects often continue for many years as a continuum of work. Rather than building to a single publication moment as monographs do, digital projects often mark mark progress through a series of significant milestones. DHCommons will provide a concrete way to certify the value of long-standing, influential, but unfinished projects to colleagues unfamiliar with the contours of digital scholarship.

### [The Advanced Research Consortium](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/about/peer-review/)
A collection of nodes organized around specifically literary periods or movements. Includes nodes for C19 literature ([NINES](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/nines/)), C18 literature ([18thConnect](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/18thconnect/)), and medieval literature ([MESA](http://idhmcmain.tamu.edu/arcgrant/people/mesa/)) and is growing.
